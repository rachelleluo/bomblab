This is bomb 1341.

It belongs to rtl64 (rtl64@scarletmail.rutgers.edu)

Here is my process for defusing my bomb.

Phase 1:
Going into the bomb.s file, find the phase_1 section. It will look like this:
0000000000001627 <phase_1>:
    1627:	f3 0f 1e fa          	endbr64 
    162b:	48 83 ec 08          	sub    $0x8,%rsp
    162f:	48 8d 35 16 1b 00 00 	lea    0x1b16(%rip),%rsi        # 314c <_IO_stdin_used+0x14c>
    1636:	e8 c0 04 00 00       	call   1afb <strings_not_equal>
    163b:	85 c0                	test   %eax,%eax
    163d:	75 05                	jne    1644 <phase_1+0x1d>
    163f:	48 83 c4 08          	add    $0x8,%rsp
    1643:	c3                   	ret    
    1644:	e8 a1 07 00 00       	call   1dea <explode_bomb>
    1649:	eb f4                	jmp    163f <phase_1+0x18>

You can see that it is calling a function called strings not equal. Then there's a jne line that jumps to the explode bomb
line if they are not euqal. Going into the debugger and stepping through, you want to look at what phrase your phrase is
being compared to. The phrase that your input is being compared to is the answer to the first phase. In this case,
the answer was "The early bird gets the worm."

Phase 2:
Going into the bomb.s file, find the phase_2 section. It will look like this:
000000000000164b <phase_2>:
    164b:	f3 0f 1e fa          	endbr64

    165c:	00 00 
    165e:	48 89 44 24 18       	mov    %rax,0x18(%rsp)
    1663:	31 c0                	xor    %eax,%eax
    1665:	48 89 e6             	mov    %rsp,%rsi

    167a:	e8 6b 07 00 00       	call   1dea <explode_bomb>
    167f:	48 89 e5             	mov    %rsp,%rbp
    1682:	bb 02 00 00 00       	mov    $0x2,%ebx
    1687:	eb 0c                	jmp    1695 <phase_2+0x4a>
    1689:	83 c3 01             	add    $0x1,%ebx
    168c:	48 83 c5 04          	add    $0x4,%rbp
    1690:	83 fb 06             	cmp    $0x6,%ebx
    1693:	74 11                	je     16a6 <phase_2+0x5b>
    1695:	89 d8                	mov    %ebx,%eax
    1697:	03 45 00             	add    0x0(%rbp),%eax
    169a:	39 45 08             	cmp    %eax,0x8(%rbp)
    169d:	74 ea                	je     1689 <phase_2+0x3e>
    169f:	e8 46 07 00 00       	call   1dea <explode_bomb>
    16a4:	eb e3                	jmp    1689 <phase_2+0x3e>
    16a6:	48 8b 44 24 18       	mov    0x18(%rsp),%rax
    16ab:	64 48 2b 04 25 28 00 	sub    %fs:0x28,%rax
    16b2:	00 00 
    16b4:	75 07                	jne    16bd <phase_2+0x72>
    16b6:	48 83 c4 28          	add    $0x28,%rsp
    16ba:	5b                   	pop    %rbx

    16bd:	e8 be fb ff ff       	call   1280 <__stack_chk_fail@plt>

On line 38, it is calling a function called compare 6 numbers. Knowing this, we can assume that the answer will be 6 numbers.
The bomb is going through each one of your numbers and comparing it to the answer. If a number is correct, it will jump
over the explode bomb. If it is incorrect, it will explode. You can technically brute force to find the answer. Starting with
the input 1 2 3 4 5 6, use the debugger to step through one step at a time. Check to see if the first number 1 explodes the 
bomb. If it doesn't, you know that the first number is 1. If it does, then the first number is 1. If you continue this process,
you will see the answer is 1 2 3 5 7 10.

Phase 3:
Going to the bomb.s file, find the phase_3 section. It will look like this:
00000000000016c2 <phase_3>:
    16c2:	f3 0f 1e fa          	endbr64

This one is a bit hard to explain, but this youtube video does a great job explaining how to diffuse this phase.

Phase 4: 
Again, go to the bomb.s file and find the phase_4 section. It is very long, so I won't be pasting it here.
What this phase is essentially doing, is it is looping through a 6 character string. It assigns each character a number
then finds the sum of the string. That is the simplest way to put it. Again, you can brute force this. Step through the
bomb with a string like abcdef. At each step, see what value it assigns a, b, c, d, e, and f. Take note of this. Continue 
this process until you've tested every letter of the alphabet. There is a very important compare statement 
cmp    %eax,0x4(%rsp). You should find the value of rsp and multiply by 4. This should be the sum of the string. Given
the numbers you found, you should be able to make any 6 character string with any letter as long as their corresponding
numbers equal the sum it is being compared to. In this case, the solution was apomoo.

Phase 5:
Again, go to the bomb.s file and find the phase_5 section. In short, the assembly code has 6 nodes. 5 nodes have values that
you can find fairly easily by just stepping through the code. The last node, has a hidden value. The assembly code
wants to know the order of the nodes from least to greatest (certain bombs may ask from greatest to least). Find the values
of the 5 nodes and put them in order from least to greatest. Then you can brute force the rest. For example, I fonund the 
order of the first 5 to be 2 5 4 3 1. From here, I tried 6 2 5 4 3 1 as my input and stepped through. If it exploded, I tried
the next option which was 2 6 5 4 3 1 and so on. In this case, the solution was 2 5 4 3 6 1.
